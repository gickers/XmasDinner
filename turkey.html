    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 turkey crown (about 1.8-2.7 kilograms)</li>
      <li>115 grams unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh sage, chopped</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>240 ml chicken or turkey/chicken stock</li>
      <li>Optional: 1 lemon, quartered, for added flavor</li>
      <li>Optional: Root vegetables for roasting</li>
      <li>Optional: streaky bacon</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Method</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 163째C (325째F).</li>
    <li>Rinse the turkey crown under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix the softened butter with minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. This creates a flavorful herb butter.</li>
    <li>Carefully lift the skin of the turkey crown, creating a pocket. Rub about two-thirds of the herb butter under the skin, ensuring an even distribution.</li>
    <li>Rub the remaining herb butter over the outside of the turkey crown, coating it thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Place the turkey crown in a roasting pan. If desired, surround it with quartered lemons and root vegetables for added flavor.</li>
    <li>Pour the chicken or turkey broth into the bottom of the pan to keep the meat moist during roasting.</li>
    <li>Cover the turkey crown loosely with foil and place it in the preheated oven.</li>
    <li>Roast for approximately 20 minutes per kilogram, basting the turkey with pan juices every 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the foil during the last 30-45 minutes of cooking to allow the skin to crisp up and turn golden brown.</li>
    <li>Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. The internal temperature should reach 74째C (165째F).</li>
    <li>Once done, let the turkey crown rest for 15-20 minutes before carving.</li>
   </ol>
